user_description: I\'m a nomad Software Engineer, always searching for the next challenge; no task is too scary nor too difficult. Lately I have been immersed in the <b>crypto-world</b> working for Radix, a London based startup trying to create the next massive scalable DLT. I'm one of the two guys behind all the JS related stuff. Visit my blog here <a href="https://github.com/andrevill-dev"" target="_blank">https://github.com/andrevill-dev"</a>
